  <h2 class="h0">About</h2>
  <p class="about large intro">I'm a freelance writer, engineer, and adventure cyclist based in Berlin. <br> My long-form profiles, routes, and stories from the heart get published on <a href="https://bikepacking.com/author/josh-meissner/" target="_blank">BIKEPACKING.com</a>. 
  <br> With my engineering background, I deliver early-stage feedback on prototypes to product teams at various outdoor equipment manufacturers.
   <br> I've worked in science communication & PR at <a href="https://www.iuk.fraunhofer.de/" target="_blank">Fraunhofer</a> and have experience in technical translations in industrial and academic contexts.
