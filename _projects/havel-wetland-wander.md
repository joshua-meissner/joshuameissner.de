**Brandenburg**

Situated just beyond Berlin and meandering its way through the Westhavelland Nature Park, the Havel Wetland Wander is a 170-kilometer mixed-surface weekend route that takes riders through a scenic and serene region that's teeming with wildlife. It boasts empty forests, uniquely dark skies for stargazing, and a glimpse of typical eastern German towns.
